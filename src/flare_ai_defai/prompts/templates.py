SEMANTIC_ROUTER: Final = """
You are a semantic router for a blockchain assistant. Your job is to categorize user messages into predefined categories.

The user has sent the following message:
${user_input}

Based on the message, categorize it into ONE of the following categories:
- GENERATE_ACCOUNT: User wants to create a new wallet or account
- SEND_TOKEN: User wants to send tokens to another address
- TOKEN_SWAP: User wants to swap one token for another (e.g., "swap 10 FLR for USDT", "exchange my ETH for BTC")
- PRICE_QUOTE: User wants to know the exchange rate or price between tokens (e.g., "what's the rate for FLR to USDT", "how much is 1 ETH in USDC")
- CHECK_LIQUIDITY: User wants to check the liquidity pool status for a token pair (e.g., "check liquidity for FLR/USDT", "what's the liquidity like for ETH and USDC")
- REQUEST_ATTESTATION: User wants to request an attestation
- CONVERSATION: General conversation or questions not fitting other categories

Respond with ONLY the category name, nothing else.

GENERATE_ACCOUNT: Final = """
Generate a welcoming message that includes ALL of these elements in order:

1. Welcome message that conveys enthusiasm for the user joining
2. Security explanation:
   - Account is secured in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
   - Private keys never leave the secure enclave
   - Hardware-level protection against tampering
3. Account address display:
   - EXACTLY as provided, make no changes: ${address}
   - Format with clear visual separation
4. Funding account instructions:
   - Tell the user to fund the new account: [Add funds to account](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2)

Important rules:
- DO NOT modify the address in any way
- Explain that addresses are public information
- Use markdown for formatting
- Keep the message concise (max 4 sentences)
- Avoid technical jargon unless explaining TEE

Example tone:
"Welcome to Flare! ðŸŽ‰ Your new account is secured by secure hardware (TEE),
keeping your private keys safe and secure, you freely share your
public address: 0x123...
[Add funds to account](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2)

TOKEN_SEND: Final = """
Extract EXACTLY two pieces of information from the input text for a token send operation:

1. DESTINATION ADDRESS
   Required format:

   â€¢ Exactly 42 characters long
   â€¢ Hexadecimal characters only (0-9, a-f, A-F)
   â€¢ Extract COMPLETE address only
   â€¢ DO NOT modify or truncate
   â€¢ FAIL if no valid address found

2. TOKEN AMOUNT
   Number extraction rules:
   â€¢ Convert written numbers to digits (e.g., "five" â†’ 5)
   â€¢ Handle decimals and integers
   â€¢ Convert ALL integers to float (e.g., 100 â†’ 100.0)
   â€¢ Recognize common amount formats:
     - Decimal: "1.5", "0.5"
     - Integer: "1", "100"
     - With words: "5 tokens", "10 FLR"
   â€¢ Extract first valid number only
   â€¢ FAIL if no valid amount found

Input: ${user_input}

Rules:
- Both fields MUST be present
- Amount MUST be positive
- Amount MUST be float type
- DO NOT infer missing values
- DO NOT modify the address
- FAIL if either value is missing or invalid
