SEMANTIC_ROUTER: Final = """
You are a semantic router for a blockchain assistant. Your job is to categorize user messages into predefined categories.

The user has sent the following message:
${user_input}

Based on the message, categorize it into ONE of the following categories:
- GENERATE_ACCOUNT: User wants to create a new wallet or account
- SEND_TOKEN: User wants to send tokens to another address
- TOKEN_SWAP: User wants to swap one token for another (e.g., "swap 10 FLR for USDT", "exchange my ETH for BTC")
- PRICE_QUOTE: User wants to know the exchange rate or price between tokens (e.g., "what's the rate for FLR to USDT", "how much is 1 ETH in USDC")
- CHECK_LIQUIDITY: User wants to check the liquidity pool status for a token pair (e.g., "check liquidity for FLR/USDT", "what's the liquidity like for ETH and USDC")
- REQUEST_ATTESTATION: User wants to request an attestation
- CONVERSATION: General conversation or questions not fitting other categories

Respond with ONLY the category name, nothing else.
"""

GENERATE_ACCOUNT: Final = """
Generate a welcoming message that includes ALL of these elements in order:

1. Welcome message that conveys enthusiasm for the user joining
2. Security explanation:
   - Account is secured in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
   - Private keys never leave the secure enclave
   - Hardware-level protection against tampering
3. Account address display:
   - EXACTLY as provided, make no changes: ${address}
   - Format with clear visual separation
4. Funding account instructions:
   - Tell the user to fund the new account: [Add funds to account](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2)

Important rules:
- DO NOT modify the address in any way
- Explain that addresses are public information
- Use markdown for formatting
- Keep the message concise (max 4 sentences)
- Avoid technical jargon unless explaining TEE

Example tone:
"Welcome to Flare! ðŸŽ‰ Your new account is secured by secure hardware (TEE),
keeping your private keys safe and secure, you freely share your
public address: 0x123...
[Add funds to account](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2)

TOKEN_SEND: Final = """
You are a JSON parser extracting token transfer information.

Your task is to extract TWO pieces of information from the following input and return them in a valid JSON format:

Input: ${user_input}

1. Extract the DESTINATION ADDRESS:
   - Must start with "0x"
   - Must be exactly 42 characters long (including "0x")
   - Contains only hexadecimal characters (0-9, a-f, A-F)
   - Do not modify the address in any way

2. Extract the TOKEN AMOUNT:
   - Must be a positive number
   - Convert any spelled-out numbers to digits (e.g., "five" -> 5.0)
   - Return as a float value even if it's a whole number (e.g., "1" -> 1.0)
   - Look for amounts in various formats:
     * Simple numbers: "1", "5.5"
     * With token symbol: "1 FLR", "5.5 tokens", "0.1 flr"
     * In verb phrases: "transfer 1 FLR", "send 5.5 tokens", "send 0.1 flr"
   - If the amount appears before the token symbol, extract it correctly (e.g., "0.1 FLR")

Return a valid JSON object with exactly these two fields:
{
  "to_address": "the extracted address",
  "amount": the extracted amount as a float
}

IMPORTANT:
- Both fields MUST be present in your JSON
- The "amount" field MUST be a float (not a string)
- Return ONLY this JSON object, nothing else

Examples:
For input: "transfer 1 FLR to 0x257B2457b10C02d393458393515F51dc8880300d"
Return: {"to_address": "0x257B2457b10C02d393458393515F51dc8880300d", "amount": 1.0}

For input: "send 5.5 FLR to address 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
Return: {"to_address": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890", "amount": 5.5}

For input: "send 0.1 flr to 0x257B2457b10C02d393458393515F51dc8880300d"
Return: {"to_address": "0x257B2457b10C02d393458393515F51dc8880300d", "amount": 0.1}

Negative Examples:
For input: "What is the balance of 0x257B2457b10C02d393458393515F51dc8880300d"
Do NOT return: {"to_address": "0x257B2457b10C02d393458393515F51dc8880300d", "amount": null} # This is not a transfer request

For input: "I don't want to send any tokens"
Do NOT return: {"to_address": null, "amount": 0.0} # There is no valid transfer request here

Respond with ONLY this JSON object, nothing else.
